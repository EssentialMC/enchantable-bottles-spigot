# Enchantable Bottles - Spigot 1.14.4

This plugin does a very simple thing. Turn Water Bottles into Bottles of Enchanting by right-clicking (place block) an Enchanting Table. Each bottle will remove some random experience between 3 and 12 points. This operates at a slight loss because Bottles of Enchanting give between 3 and 11 experience points.
